## Covalent UI Platform resource files

Resource files for the open-source [Teradata Covalent UI Platform](https://teradata.github.io/covalent/)

### Goal

The goal of these resources is to allow designers & developers to design prototypes and seamlessly transition between roles, and to hand off mockups that will not result in the need for custom coding.

Components should be reusable and ubiquitous across the design applications and the platform. 

### Available resources:

* [Adobe Illustrator](illustrator)
* [Sketch](sketch)

#### Included in templates

- Layouts
- Components
- Design Patterns
- Color Palettes
- Icons
